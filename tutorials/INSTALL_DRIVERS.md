# This is a tutorial on how to install the motor drivers and curve library

1. In the arduino sketchbook folder, there is a sub-directory called `libraries`
2. Create a folder in the `libraries`directory called `robotica_Inno22`

files should run fine if `filename` is included

!! ATTENTION !!
-----------------------------------------
The files will only run from the Arduino IDE, as that has the correct include path for the lirary. Idk yet how to fix it that vscode can compile the file.
