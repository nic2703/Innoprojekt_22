/**
 * @brief these are all the pins that are used by the plotter library
 * brakes, speed and dir are for the two main motors
 * servo is obvious, as is switch
 * 
 * switch must remain on pin 2, as that is the only free pin to support hardware interrupts
 * 
 * _RX and _TX are for the rx and tx pins of the bluetooth shield respectively,
 * however there is currently no inbuilt support for any messaging protocol, so these are unused
 * 
 * @warning when pins 0 and/or 1 are conected to anything during upload to arduino, the upload may fail
 * this is due to the arduino using its serial ports to interface with the USB and as pins 0 and 1 
 * are directly connected to serial, the data may be corrupted.
